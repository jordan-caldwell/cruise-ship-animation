# Cruise Ship Loading Animation
An experiment animating an svg with CSS.

Built using [Bootstrap 4 boilerplate project](https://github.com/JayeshLab/bootstrap-4-sass-gulp-4-boilerplate.git) for quick startup time. 

## Next Steps
- Polish animation timing
- Investigate issue with scaling smoke clouds
- Clean up animation.scss and use mixins
